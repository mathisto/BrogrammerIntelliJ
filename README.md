# Brogrammer for IntelliJ IDEA Editor
Brogrammer is a flat sexy Sublime Text theme. Pushups not included.

[Ken Wheeler](https://github.com/kenwheeler) deserves ALL credit for this. I simply ported it as best I could to IntelliJ IDEA.

Some aspects are not perfectly reproducable due to the way IntelliJ handles syntax vs Sublime. Feel free to make a PR if you see an opportunity for imporvement.
